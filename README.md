# SSH_RevShell

SSH_RevShell is a simple reverse shell that uses SSH (Secure Shell) to connect to the server. It consists of server (written in python) and client (written in go). I've also implemented downloading and uploading files (upload and download commands). Tested on Windows 10 and Kali Linux
